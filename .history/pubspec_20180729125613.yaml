name: icons_helper
description: This is a convenience package that provides bracket notiation access to Material Design Icons and Font Awesome Flutter icons (via @brianegan's font_awesome_flutter package). For now, I have just statically generated the Map to map string names to member names. This means any new icons won't be automatically discovered. There's a way to use codegen and mirror in a non-flutter dart app to generate this and then output/maintain them, but just using a google sheet and cut and pasting was faster for something I personally don't need to update often. That sheet is here at

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
